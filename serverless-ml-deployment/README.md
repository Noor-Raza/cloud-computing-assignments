# Serverless Machine Learning Deployment

This project demonstrates deploying a machine learning model using **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**.  
It covers training, packaging, deploying, and testing a serverless ML application.

## 📝 Overview
- Trained a simple ML model.  
- Packaged the model for serverless deployment.  
- Wrote a Lambda handler to serve predictions.  
- Integrated AWS Lambda with API Gateway for REST API access.  
- Tested predictions using real inputs.
